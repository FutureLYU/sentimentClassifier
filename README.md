# Movie Review Sentiment Classifier
## Hanxi Lyu
The project is based on the ISE 590 directed research of University of Southern California. This is a full-stack website with machine learning model embeded in the Flask backend service. It can be used to classify whether the sentiment of a movie review is postive or negtive. The website can collect real time data from the user submission and update the backend model. The structure of the project is built on React and Flask. The template of this project can be used to make fast deployment with new machine learning models.
